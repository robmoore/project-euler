-- We only need the first value so really a lazy list would be preferable. However, the result
-- from map is not sorted (a high fst value and a low snd value results in a palindrome may be
-- less than what will be returned subsequently in the next fst value (998, say) and a higher
-- snd value (that is, the sum of the later multicand and the multiplier are greater than the
-- former value). Hence, this implementation must sort the results to determine a solution.
